If you would like to contribute to the IATI Public Validator project....

* We're interested in user experience and feedback from using the application.
* We'd like people to fix bugs and contribute to features.
* We're interested in people using the code for their own purposes.
* We're interested in suggestions, modifications and improvements.

Deployment
----------
If you find any issues in deploying your own version of the code we'd love to hear about it and try to improve our documentation.

User Interface
--------------
Can you improve the user interface? Can you make it look 'nicer'?

Statistics
----------
Can you check that the tests are telling us what we think they are telling us?
Do you have other tests that we could be generating?

Unit Tests
----------
Can you improve the unit testing to make deployment more robust

Fix a Bitesize issue
--------------------
We mark some of issues as `'Bitesize' <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Public-Validator/issues?labels=Bitesize&milestone=&page=1&state=open>`__. Generally these will help ease you into the code and help you find your way around.
